Key Controls----

Escape - For closing the window

To select the root of the models for moving them about their centroid ----

    F3 - Humanoid
    F4 - Dog
    F0 - Box


For selecting the joint as the current node---

--------HUMANOID----------

    H = torso2  
    F7 = neck 
    Y = shoulderr
    U = shoulderl
    T = elbowr
    I = elbowl
    R = handr
    O = handl
    B = hipr
    N = hipl
    V = kneer
    M = kneel
    C = footr
    COMMA = footl

----------DOG--------------

    LEFT_BRACKET = dogneck; 
    RIGHT_BRACKET = dogtail; 
    J = dogarm1; 
    K = dogarm2; 
    L = dogarm3; 
    SEMICOLON = dogarm4; 
    APOSTROPHE = dogtail;     

---------BOX---------------

    0 = box (basically lowerbox(root)); 
    1 = openbox();
    2 = closebox();


For rotating the selected joint as the current node---

    LEFT = decrease angle of rotation along y-axis by 5 degrees 
    RIGHT = increase angle of rotation along y-axis by 5 degrees 
    UP = decrease angle of rotation along x-axis by 5 degrees 
    DOWN = increase angle of rotation along x-axis by 5 degrees 
    PAGE_UP = decrease angle of rotation along z-axis by 5 degrees 
    PAGE_DOWN = increase angle of rotation along z-axis by 5 degrees 


For toggling between opening and closing umbrella ----
    5 - toggle

For Perspective vision-------

    P = toggle between enabling & disabling perspective;   


For rotating the world------- (kept granularity of rotation = 5 degrees for easablity)

    A  = y axis rotates by -5.0 degrees
    D  = y axis rotates by +5.0 degrees
    W  = x axis rotates by -5.0 degrees
    S  = x axis rotates by +5.0 degrees        
    Q  = z axis rotates by -5.0 degrees
    E  = z axis rotates by +5.0 degrees   


----------CAMERA CONTROLS-----------

	LEFT SHIFT = Zoom Out
	RIGHT SHIFT = Zoom In
	KEYPAD 1 = Move Camera along positive X axis
	KEYPAD 3 = Move Camera along negative X axis
	KEYPAD 4 = Move Camera along positive Y axis
	KEYPAD 6 = Move Camera along negative Y axis
	KEYPAD 7 = Move Camera along positive Z axis
	KEYPAD 9 = Move Camera along negative Z axis

Note : Camera Motion controls are on keypad numbers (Not the number buttons placed below function buttons)


We have done following tasks :
	Created Room and added table
